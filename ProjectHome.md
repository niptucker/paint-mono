This project will host the source code to port [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net) from Windows in .NET to Unix using Mono.   This is not an official port, it is being done by members of the open source community.

See the PortingStrategy document for more information on building, hacking and contributing to this effort.

**Important:** you currently need Mono from SVN and MonoDevelop from SVN to build Paint.NET
